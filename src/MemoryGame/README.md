# Memory Game

In a memory game, several pairs of tiles are placed face down in a grid. The point of the game is to flip over tiles and match the pairs together. If the images on the facing tiles match, the matching tiles are removed. If the images do not match, the tiles are flipped back face down. The object of the game is to find all pairs. The game is over when all the tiles are gone.
